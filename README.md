## 🧩 Key Insights
- **Nykaa-owned brands dominate** with 1,253 SKUs (~40% of portfolio) → signals strong private label play.  
- **Out-of-stock products** in brands like Biotique (370 SKUs, many unavailable) → lost sales potential.  
- **Top 10 brands** (Nykaa, Biotique, Lakme, Lotus, Maybelline etc.) make up ~70% of total inventory.  
- **Discount-heavy SKUs** (up to 60%+) drive traffic but risk profitability.  
- **Higher-rated brands** like Kay Beauty & Faces Canada (avg. >4.3) → customer loyalty levers.
